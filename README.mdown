# Hubot Incoming Webhook

A (very simple) hubot script for sending messages to a channel/room via HTTP
POST requests to your bot.

## Installation

Install script package in your bot's repository:

    npm install --save hubot-incoming-webhook

Add to `external_scripts.json`:

```json
[
  "hubot-incoming-webhook"
]
```

Set the `WEBHOOK_TOKEN` environment variable to a secret string of your choice
when running the bot. It will be used in the incoming webhook URLs.

## Usage

### Generic hooks

The URL is constructed as follows: `http(s)://<host>:<port>/incoming/<your-secret-token>`

Just POST a simple JSON body to the webhook URL.

| Key | Value |
| --- | ----- |
| room | (string) The room/channel you want to post to. |
| message | (string/array) The message you want to post. Can be an array for multiple lines. |

Example:

```sh
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"room": "#kosmos", "message": "ohai"}' \
     http://127.0.0.1:8080/incoming/your-secret-token
```

### UptimeRobot

The URL is constructed as follows: `http(s)://<host>:<port>/incoming/uptimerobot/<your-secret-token>`

In [UptimeRobot's settings](https://uptimerobot.com/dashboard#mySettings),
add the following webhook as an alert contact (you must set the room that you
want to bot to send messages to):

```
http(s)://<host>:<port>/incoming/uptimerobot/<your-secret-token>?room=ops@example.com&
```

Don't forget the trailing ampersand, this is required so UptimeRobot can add
their query strings to the request for the monitor ID, status, and so on.

Enable the webhook Alert Contact for each monitor. You can perform a
[bulk action](https://uptimerobot.com/dashboard#bulkActions) to do it for all
at once.

### IRC

Include the hash character for IRC channels in the `room` value.

### Mattermost (tested with hubot-matteruser)

Find the unique ID of the channel (not the display name) and use it for the `room` value.

## Configuration

| Key | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| `WEBHOOK_TOKEN` | A string for building your secret webhook URLs
